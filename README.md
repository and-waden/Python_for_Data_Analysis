# Python_for_Data_Analysis
This is a Skillfactory course of Applied Data Analytics with Python.

This crash course on how to manipulate data with Python packages such as pandas, numpy, matplotpib, seaborn. 
I took this course as a maraphon to complete in 8 weeks (the start date was 13.11.19).

The structure of the repository resembles the name of the course topic. 
Kindly, pay attention the initial language of the course is Russian, hence, task descriptions as well comments to the code is in Russian. 
I plan to translate it to English later.
